Aim: Copying File to Hadoop. -Copy from Hadoop File system and deleting file. -Moving and displaying
files in HDFS.
Software: Following software’s are required to perform this experiment:-
1. Hadoop 3.2.4
2. Window 10 operating system
Theory : 
We will be using a small text file in local file system. To put it in hdfs using hdfs command line tool.
Create a directory named ‘sample’ in my hadoop directory using the following command

hdfs dfs –mkdir /sample
To verify if the directory is created in hdfs, we will use ‘ls’ command which will list the files present in
hdfs –
hdfs dfs –ls /

Then I will copy a text file named ‘potatoes’ from my local file system to this folder that I just created in
hdfs using copyFromLocal commandhdfs dfs -copyFromLocal C:\Users\hp\Downloads\potatoes.txt /sample

To verify if the file is copied to the folder, I will use ‘ls’ command by specifying the folder name which
will read the list of files in that folder –
hdfs dfs –ls /sample

To view the contents of the file we copied, I will use cat command
hdfs dfs –cat /sample/potatoes.txt

To Copy file from hdfs to local directory, I will use get command –
hdfs dfs -get /sample/potatoes.txt C:\Users\hp\Desktop\priyanka


Code : 
hdfs dfs -ls/

hdfs dfs - mkdir /test1

hdfs dfs -ls/

//Then I will copy a text file named ‘hello’ from my local file system to this folder that 
//I just created in hdfs using copyFromLocal command-
hdfs dfs -copyFromLocal C:\Users\hp\Downloads\hello.txt /test1

hdfs dfs -ls/test1

To view the contents of the file we copied, I will use cat command-
hdfs dfs –cat /test1/hello.txt

//To Copy file from hdfs to local directory, I will use get command – 
hdfs dfs -get /test1/hello.txt C:\Users\hp\Desktop\priyanka

remove a file 
hdfs dfs -rm /test1/hello.txt
