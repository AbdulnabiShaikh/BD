Aim: Perform CRUD operations in MongoDB

Theory : 
MongoDB CRUD operations
Create Operations –
The create or insert operations are used to insert or add new documents in the collection. If a collection
does not exist, then it will create a new collection in the database. You can perform, create operations
using the following methods provided by the MongoDB:
db.collection.insertOne()
dg.collection.insertMany()

Read Operations –
The Read operations are used to retrieve documents from the collection, or in other words, read
operations are used to query a collection for a document. You can perform read operation using the
following method provided by the MongoDB:
Example : In this example, we are retrieving the details of students from the student collection using
db.collection.find() method

Update Operations –
The update operations are used to update or modify the existing document in the collection. You can
perform update operations using the following methods provided by the MongoDB:

db.collection.updateOne()
db.collection.updateMany()
db.collection.replaceOne()


Delete Operations –
The delete operation are used to delete or remove the documents from a collection. You can perform
delete operations using the following methods provided by the MongoDB:
db.collection.deleteOne()
db.collection.deleteMany()

Code : 
main> use employee
switched to db employee
employee> db.createCollection('employees')

employee> db.employees.insertOne({name:'raja',role:'software developer',salary:70000})

employee> db.employees.insertMany([{name:'ram',role:'backend',salary:50000},{name:'sanjay',role:'frontend',salary:40000}])

employee> db.employees.find()

employee> db.employees.updateOne({name:'sanjay'},{$set:{role:'backend'}})

employee> db.employees.find()

employee> db.employees.updateMany({role:'backend'},{$set:{salary:100000}})
